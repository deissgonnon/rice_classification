 We classify five rice variants, i.e., Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine and Karacadag,  grown in Turkey. A total of 75,000 grain images, 15,000 from each of these varieties, are included in the dataset. We use a machine learning techniques, specifically leveraging the TensorFlow framework. Utilizing the Rice Image Dataset, which comprises 75,000 images across five distinct rice varieties—Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag—this study outlines the data preprocessing steps, model architecture, training procedures, and evaluation metrics employed to achieve accurate classification. The developed convolutional neural network (CNN) demonstrates promising performance, highlighting the efficacy of deep learning methodologies in agricultural image classification tasks.
